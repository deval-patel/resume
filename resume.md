## Experience
### Qualcomm — Embedded ML Software Engineer May 2022 - Present
		- Led eNPU (embedded neural processing unit) driver design in C for Qualcomm's LPAI (low power AI) automotive chip through HPG-based modifications for multi-master DSP support, enabling faster iteration development and 3 months ahead of pre-silicon schedule.
		- Achieved cross-platform support (mobile, automotive, IoT, XR/VR) for the eNPU driver through code refactoring and streamlining, resulting in a simpler, unified codebase.
		- Optimized eNPU driver code for ultra-low latency (2-3 microseconds) on an RTOS, achieving industry-leading performance and real-time processing.
		- Reduced eNPU driver TCM memory footprint by 50\
		- Performed pre-silicon verification on FPGAs identifying and rectifying driver issues, accelerating SoC bring-up and reducing development time.
		- Built a system for high fidelity eAI model profiling (hardware vs. software scheduling) to identify latency bottlenecks in customer models. Automated this workflow using a custom Python script invoking ADB shell commands (model/binary deployment, test execution, CSV data collection, Excel report generation).
		- Delivered a well-received presentation to internal and external teams on next-gen automotive chip driver development, enhancing their understanding of new architecture and functionalities.
### University of Toronto — Teaching Assistant for Operating Systems/Software Design/Intro. to CS Jan 2020 - May 2022
		- Led 2 hour practical sessions communicating troubling concepts and guiding 30 students through exercises while encouraging a positive and collaborative environment.
		- Solely created major assignments with Python and Java.
		- Created automarking test suites using PyTest, JUnit and Bash resulting in a 200\
## Projects
### https://utapcsc.utm.utoronto.ca/utap/ — Lead Developer Jan 2021 - May 2022
TA Application System
		- Migrated an existing HTML application to React and created reusable components resulting in a reduction of duplicate code.
		- Added REST API endpoints allowing contracts to be generated, downloaded, signed and uploaded using ExpressJS and PostgreSQL resulting in a 200\
		- Developed SQL queries enabling instructors to parse student applications by grade, time availability, and many other filters.
[Co-Creator/Developer  Jan 2021 - May 2021]Carden
		- Created an appealing website using React and MaterialUI allowing users to create and send interactive e-cards at the time of a global pandemic.
		- Stored and retrieved user data, media and e-cards using MongoDB and AWS S3.
