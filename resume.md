## Experience
### Microsoft — SDE II  — Graphics Kernel (Core OS) 2025 - Present
    - Investigated GPU/OS performance across NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm hardware using GPUView, WPA, and kernel trace analysis, identifying vendor driver issues and OS scheduling inefficiencies.
    - Diagnosed and fixed a critical scheduling bug where workloads were incorrectly placed into a penalty box after power-transition sleep states, restoring correct QoS behavior and improving GPU responsiveness.
    - Led design for the next-generation Hardware Scheduler Logging System, enabling packet-level start/stop telemetry, VM utilization metrics, and significantly improved debugging scope for GPUView.
    - Enhanced TDR (Timeout Detection \& Recovery) logic to better identify true GPU hangs and reduce false positives during hardware bring-up and partner validation.
    - Built and flashed Windows OS test builds, performed low-level validation on internal hardware, and debugged crashes/hangs using WinDBG and GPU scheduling traces.
### Qualcomm — Embedded ML Software Engineer 2022 - 2025
    - Designed eNPU (embedded neural processing unit) driver in C for Qualcomm’s LPAI automotive chip, enabling multi-master DSP support and advancing pre-silicon schedules by 3 months.
    - Optimized eNPU firmware for 2–3µs latency on RTOS, achieving industry-leading real-time ML inference performance.
    - Delivered cross-platform driver support across automotive, mobile, IoT, and XR/VR devices through large-scale refactoring and system unification.
    - Performed pre-silicon verification on FPGA platforms, identifying and resolving critical bring-up issues for next-generation SoCs.
    - Built automated eAI model profiling pipeline (Python + ADB) comparing HW vs. SW scheduling to diagnose model latency bottlenecks for internal customers.
## Projects
### https://github.com/deval-patel/careOverflow — Lead ML Engineer 2025 - Present
CareOverflow — Disease Diagnosis with BioBERT
    - Built a complete ML pipeline using PyTorch, BioBERT, and custom transformers to classify symptoms into 41 diseases (85–95\
    - Implemented dataset preprocessing, structured vs.\ natural-language formatting, and train/val/test splitting with custom PyTorch Dataset classes.
    - Designed a modular configuration-driven training framework supporting AdamW optimization, label smoothing, gradient accumulation, and per-class evaluation metrics.
    - Developed inference engine for both structured and natural-language inputs, supporting top-k predictions and GPU/CPU dispatch.
    - Architected a pluggable interface allowing additional transformer models and trainers with minimal integration overhead.
